Briefly About Myself:

Can say Iâ€™m a junior software developer. Have worked in several fields and positions. From a conveyor worker in a plywood factory, self employed as carpenter, then roofer combined with supervisor and estimator. Til a director for a small/almost middle  company (2016-2019) we worked on soil drainage. 
I love movement of any kind. I'm active physically and the same way I like to move my brains, can even replace activities with working on brain tasks. When demand on drainage dramatically fell I started to search for new fields where I can be useful, and chose programming. Still newbie in mind, but I can see some progress and will work hard to achieve good results.
